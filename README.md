### Hi I'm Lewis 👋

💻  Senior Software Developer [@knowndecimal](https://github.com/knowndecimal)

☕️ Brewer of fine coffees

I'm a full stack developer. I really enjoy Ruby on Rails, but like to contribute at any part of the web stack. I'll be brewing coffee in my Chemex most mornings. In the winter, I hope to be snowboarding!
